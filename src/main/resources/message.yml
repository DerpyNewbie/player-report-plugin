# Additional info!
#   "usage" info:
#     All placeholders has placeholder of "{USAGE}".
#     this placeholder shows message of each "usage" value of commands.
#     pretty useful to show player how to use commands. isn't it?
#
#     usage has one placeholders can be use. it's <command>!
#     it will be replaced to what command they used.
#     For example, when the player execute /rEpOrt.
#     <command> will be "rEpOrt"! (basically same as <command> in plugin.yml)
#
#
#   DISPLAY_NAME suffixed placeholders can be used to offline player, but shows value of NAME instead of DISPLAY NAME.
#     (shows correct display name when they are online.)

#
# default player placeholders:
#   {NAME}         : player's name.
#   {DISPLAY_NAME} : player's display name.
